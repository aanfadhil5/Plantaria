Android app to remind watering your beloved plants with integration API OpenWeather for consideration of watering plants based on weather. This project i use it for research paper in Gunadarma Univerity.

# Abstract
Caring for ornamental plants is a routine that is often done by the community. One of them is
caring for ornamental plants by providing water intake for their survival. Along with the times,
smartphones have become a necessity for every society. This causes the smartphone industry to
grow along with the operating system. The development of the Android operating system is
growing rapidly because this operating system is open source, which allows developers to easily
modify applications on this operating system according to their needs. Thus, research was
conducted by designing applications on Android-based smartphones that can help to remind users
of watering ornamental plants indoors and outdoors. This application has been tested and can be
used properly on the minimum operating system requirements, namely Android Marshmallow
(6.0).
